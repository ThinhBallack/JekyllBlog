This Jekyll Blog is an output of doing demo for reporting the subject's results for my teacher, Nguyen Dinh Anh. 
This demo is using an available theme that Jekyll provided.

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub:
